/**
 * Sentry browser telemetry — Hotel Mulin (hotelmulin.ch)
 *
 * Loaded from the CDN bundle rather than the Loader script: the org lives in
 * Sentry's EU region, and keeping the whole configuration here means sampling
 * rates and privacy settings are reviewable in git instead of hidden behind a
 * dashboard toggle. The bundle is pinned to an exact version and guarded by an
 * SRI hash, so a compromised CDN cannot execute anything on these pages.
 *
 * Both script tags are `defer`, and this file is ordered before the site's own
 * scripts. Deferred scripts run in document order, so Sentry is initialised
 * before app.js/booking.js and catches their errors, without blocking render.
